# Amanda additions:

- Hi all, so I left all functions/classes in the single script scripts/NN.py. I don't really have any main functions so it didn't make sense to split it up for me even though I know thats technically the proper way to do it. 

- You'll find I answered all the questions in Amanda_Everitt_BMI203_HW3.ipynb which I also knit to an HTML this time since I know the viewer messes up occasionally.  

- The documentation can be found at Amanda_ReadTheDocs.html which is a copy of the Project3/docs/build/html/index.html file built with Sphinx. The copied version looks a little odd so you may just want to go to the original file to read tbh.  

- The final predictions on the validation set are in rap1-lieb-test-PREDICTIONS.txt
